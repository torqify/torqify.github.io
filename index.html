 <b>FEATURES</b>
• Inflate tires for automotive vehicles [Car Truck Motorcycle RV ATV] using your air compressor pump.
• Integrated with digital pressure gauge saves you time by connecting once for fast inflation.
• Accurate to 0.1psi is great for tire pressure monitor sensors [TPMS].
• Easy one handed operation because outlet chuck locks & seals to valve stem.
• Durable with high quality heavy duty metal materials - not flimsy plastic like other inflator tools.
• Quick connect industrial type fitting already installed for your convenience.

<b>SPECIFICATIONS</b>
• SOURCE: pneumatic via your air compressor, hose, coupler fitting (not included)
• GAUGE: in line air pressure, digital, units of measurement psi bar kpa kgf/cm2, shock guard, rotatable, two AAA batteries (included), 2.5" diameter gauge, blue backlit 1.5" LCD display [composite, electronics, rubber, brass, alkaline batteries]
• HOUSING/HANDLE: ergonomic ambidextrous pistol gun style, storage hook [zinc alloy]
• TRIGGER: variable inflation finger lever style [stainless steel]
• HOSE: 14" long 3/8" outer diameter with smooth 1/4" inner diameter [braided stainless steel, rubber]
• INLET: 1/4" NPT, includes industrial type D/M quick connect fitting installed [stainless steel]
• OUTLET: Schrader valve stem chuck with locking lever [brass, stainless steel]
• DEFLATE: push button relief valve [brass]
• AIR FLOW: 3.5 CFM
• MAX PRESSURE: 200psi

<b>DIRECTIONS</b>
• For use on tires with automotive/Schrader valve stems.
• Requires an air compressor with tank. Not intended for use with small tankless compressors.
• Open battery cover on rear of gauge and install two included AAA batteries.
• Swivel gauge direction if needed.
• Wear gloves and eye protection during operation.
• Set compressor regulator to an appropriate air pressure.
• Connect coupler fitting from air hose to quick connect fitting at tool inlet.
• Secure outlet chuck to tire valve stem using lever.
• Power “On” digital pressure gauge. Press “Units” button to select measurement.
• Compress trigger to increase air pressure and inflate.
• Release trigger to review pressure gauge reading. Gauge operates while no air is passing through tool.
• Use relief valve button on side to decrease air pressure and deflate.

<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
• 1/4" NPT industrial type D/M quick coupler
• PTFE tape on hose fitting threads to prevent leaks


<b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b>
Q: Outlet chuck leaks air?
A: Ensure the chuck is pushed in as far is it will go and the hose is not pulling the chuck to the side.

Q: Cannot rotate the gauge?
A: Use of a wrench on the square brass fitting below the gauge can help rotate it the first time because of the thread sealant.

Q: Gauge reading inaccurate?
A: The gauge operates while no air is passing through the tool and must release the trigger to review the current pressure reading. If gauge measurement reading is off in excess ±3%, the gauge likely suffered a drop (possibly from shipping) to cause this. Contact us immediately if it arrived this way.

Q: Inlet fitting replacement?
A: Most replacement inlet fittings will have excess threads showing. This is normal and do not overtighten.
